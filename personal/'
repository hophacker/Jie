\opening{Dear Hiring Professional,} 

I am seeking an software engineer(C/C++) internship position for this summer 2014. 
I am currently a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University majoring security informatics and I will graduate in
December this year.

%\item Excellent algorithm design and implementation skills, with 1500+ pieces of algorithm programs written so far.
My most knowledgeable area is building softwares and solving problems which requires a very strong background in algorithm. 
This is due to my harding working of this area in the past several years. 
I started studying algorithms and hacking algorithm problems with C/C++ since I was a high school kid, which was 6
years ago. Since then, I intermittently solved more than 1500 pieces of programs among a vast area of topics in algorithm.
Hacking algorithm problems in my everyday life is just like doing homework. 
Besides that, I will choose to attend some algorithm contests to test my algorithm skills, sometimes may just for fun.
Luckily, I've done some very good performances among these contests, just for example, I attended a contest from
"hackerrank", and I ranked 42th among more than 4000 contestants at last.
My years of algorithm studying, practicing and competing requires not only a quick and clear mind in problem solving,
but also a distinguished willpower in trying things hard and new.
I've prepared my algorithm skills for many years, all I need is just a platform which I can contribute with my skills 
and demonstrate my value as a programmer. 

Besides my persistent commitment in algorithm, I tried many other topic as well, especially among math, cryptography, security, web
building, networking, android development, 
Bloomberg is a financial software, data and media company who has the mission to help different parties make smarter, faster, more profitable decisions.
What 


order to get there, we need constant ideas, energy, innovation - which is where you come in
I have built a very strong C/C++ skills as well as many other languages in the past years. 


I am currently a graduate student in The Johns Hopkins University, where I have acquired valuable skills in both computer security and software developing.
To take advantage of one's skills in his daily work enable him works more productively and more cheerfully. 
That's why I applied to this position and why I need this opportunity.    
The attached resume details my extensive experience and training in algorithm, cryptography, security, Linux, scripting languages, database and web design. 
My resume will give you an understanding my skills in a nutshell.
However, I would be able to convince you about what I have demonstrated in the resume if I'm given an interview opportunity.
Please contact me if you have any questions.

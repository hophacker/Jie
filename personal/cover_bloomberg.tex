\opening{Dear Hiring Professional,} 

I am seeking an \job{} internship position for this summer 2014.  I am currently a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University majoring security informatics and my expected graduation is December of this year.

\company{} came to our camp and held a tech talk about machine learning this Tuesday. It was a very fascinating talk
given by James which depicted how \company{} analyses the impact of social media on financial
world and financial decisions. From that talk, I saw a ambitious company who uses technology to help build a world where
different parties can make financial decisions easier, faster and better.
Though I have no previous financial experience, but since finance is so important to the world and building financial
softwares are such a valuable thing to everyone, why not have a try? As I said to myself.

%\item Excellent algorithm design and implementation skills, with 1500+ pieces of algorithm programs written so far.

%My understanding of Bloomberg is a financial software, data and media company who has the mission to help different parties make smarter, faster, more profitable decisions in this fast changing global environment.  What Bloomberg means to me and what can I do for Bloomberg as a programmer? It is a very big question, but at least I got one point from this question, that is Bloomberg can give me a broad view of the world while I'm contributing to Bloomberg with my specialties. 


My most knowledgeable area is building softwares and solving problems with algorithms, which is due to my hard working
in this area in the past several years.  
I started studying algorithms and hacking algorithm problems since I was a high school kid, which was 6 years ago. 
Since then, I intermittently solved more than 1500 pieces of programs among a vast area of topics in algorithm, most of which are written with C/C++.

Algorithm studying, practicing and competing requires not only a quick and clear mind in problem solving, but also a distinguished willpower in continually trying things hard and new.
However, I went beyond that as I took algorithm hacking for fun and would enjoy every algorithm contests I have participated ever.
In addition to my persistent commitment in algorithm, I have also led or participated in software developing in different areas like cryptography, security, web, networking, android development and reverse engineering as well. 
%Very luckily, I've accomplished some remarkable performances among these contests, such as \textbf{National First Prize} in \emph{"Lanqiao Cup"}, \textbf{Bronze Medal} in \emph{ACM-ICPC}, or \textbf{42th place} among more than 4000 global contestants in a 24-hour hackthon just a few weeks ago.

I'm very interested in \job{} since I've used \emph{C/C++} since I was a high school kid and I do really
love this language. \emph{C/C++} accounts most of my programming work, no matter it's algorithm
programming or general software building.  Recently, I have just written a \emph{C++} project called "euler" 
which contains general math algorithms and an independent big integer library.

%One special project I would like to mention is the \emph{"Universal Online Examination System"}, since it was sponsored by me.  In that project, I lead my teammates, who were all sophomore students without any web developing experience before, in building a web-based examination system. We worked hard day and night, and finally came out with a robust system which is still well serving more than 20,000 university students now.  I have a very good experience in implementing softwares, maybe my enclosed resume could tell you more about my skills and experiences.

While \company{} means a lot to me, I'm confident I will be a valuable asset to \company{} too, which can bring a
combination of extraordinary skills and passionate dedication in daily work. 
My phone number is \emph{443-996-2046} and email is \emph{jiefeng.hopkins@gmail.com}. I look forward to hearing from you and having the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications.  Thank you for your time and consideration.
